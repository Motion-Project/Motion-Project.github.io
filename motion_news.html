      <h2>2016/10/20 - Break from being fork </h2>
	  <p></p>
        With the creation of release of 4.0 and the coalescing of the various developers/forks into the
        project, it is now time to break the github project away from being a fork of SackMotion.
	  <p></p>
        Sometime after November 15 2016 the project will implement the break. When this occurs, developers
        that have previously forked from SackMotion and not forked from the project will no longer be able to see
        the project in the network graphs.
	  <p></p>
        Developers are encouraged to fork/sync from the project so that when the break occurs, they can
        continue to participate.
	  <p></p>

      <h2>2016/10/24 - Version 4.0.1 Released </h2>
	  <p></p>
        Version 4.0.1 has been packaged and released here. Only minor packaging changes are included in this
        release versus what is included in version 4.0.
	  <p></p>

      <h2>2016/10/20 - New Repo for Project </h2>
	  <p></p>
        The project now has a new repository to contain the packaging components associated with the
        Motion application. For users that wish to build the application from source, a build script has been
        created that allows for the creation of deb packages. The deb packages are preferred for building so that
        users can easily uninstall and revert to other versions.
	  <p></p>

      <h2>2016/10/16 - Version 4.0 Released </h2>
	  <p></p>
        Version 4.0 has been packaged and released here. See release notes for items included in this release.
